# chatbot
this is a chatbot application made using html,css and javascript.
I have used OPENAI's free API da-Vinci for developing this chatbot
I have also used Axios ,a promised-based HTTP client for JavaScript which has the ability to make HTTP requests from the browser and handle the transformation of request and response data.
